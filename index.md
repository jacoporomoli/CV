# Curriculum Vitae
### Ulster University

I am a Senior Lecturer and Director of the Master in Linguistics at Ulster University in Belfast. Starting in August 2020, I will be an Associate Professor in English Linguistics at the University of Bergen. I am also Honorary Associate Professor at UCL in London.

I was also an Associate Investigator at the Australian Research Councilâ€™s Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders from 2012 to 2018 and I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Cognitive Science Department at Macquarie University in Sydney. I received my PhD from Harvard University. My thesis chairs were Gennaro Chierchia, Danny Fox, Irene Heim, and Bernhard Nickel.

My research is interdisciplinary in nature and lies at the intersection between Linguistics, Philosophy of language and Psycholinguistics. In my work, I focus on the study of meaning and how it interfaces with linguistic knowledge and general cognition. I fully integrate theoretical and experimental perspectives, working on theoretical models and testing their fine-grained predictions with different psycholinguistic methods in different populations and languages.

My research has been funded by the  Leverhulme Trust, the British Academy, the Big Lottery Fund and Xprag.de.  You can find my CV here.

This year I am visiting UCL to work on a project investigating theories of alternatives for implicatures computation, funded by the Leverhulme Trust, in collaboration with Richard Breheny, Yasutada Sudo and Paul Marty.

I also work on public outreach and engagement. Since 2006, I am part of the organization of the National Geographic Science Festival in Rome. Since 2012, I am the scientific Director of the Festival together with Vittorio Bo.
